Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as `npm start`) or using `npx nodemon`.\n\n# Usage\n\nnodemon wraps your application, so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app:\n\n```bash\nnodemon [your node app]\n```\n\nFor CLI options, use the `-h` (or `--help`) argument:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -h\n```\n\nUsing nodemon is simple, if my application accepted a host and port as the arguments, I would start it as so:\n\n```bash\nnodemon ./server.js localhost 8080\n```\n\nAny output from this script is prefixed with `[nodemon]`, otherwise all output from your application, errors included, will be echoed out as expected.\n\nIf no script is given, nodemon will test for a `package.json` file and if found, will run the file associated with the *main* property ([ref](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/14)).\n\nYou can also pass the `inspect` flag to node through the command line as you would normally:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --inspect ./server.js 80\n```\n\nIf you have a `package.json` file for your app, you can omit the main script entirely and nodemon will read the `package.json` for the `main` property and use that value as the app.\n\nnodemon will also search for the `scripts.start` property in `package.json` (as of nodemon 1.1.x).\n\nAlso check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) or [issues](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues) for nodemon.\n\n## Automatic re-running\n\nnodemon was originally written to restart hanging processes such as web servers, but now supports apps that cleanly exit. If your script exits cleanly, nodemon will continue to monitor the directory (or directories) and restart the script if there are any changes.\n\n## Manual restarting\n\nWhilst nodemon is running, if you need to manually restart your application, instead of stopping and restart nodemon, you can type `rs` with a carriage return, and nodemon will restart your process.\n\n## Config files\n\nnodemon supports local and global configuration files. These are usually named `nodemon.json` and can be located in the current working directory or in your home directory. An alternative local configuration file can be specified with the `--config <file>` option.\n\nThe specificity is as follows, so that a command line argument will always override the config file settings:\n\n- command line arguments\n- local config\n- global config\n\nA config file can take any of the command line arguments as JSON key values, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"verbose\": true,\n  \"ignore\": [\"*.test.js\", \"fixtures/*\"],\n  \"execMap\": {\n    \"rb\": \"ruby\",\n    \"pde\": \"processing --sketch={{pwd}} --run\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe above `nodemon.json` file might be my global config so that I have support for ruby files and processing files, and I can run `nodemon demo.pde` and nodemon will automatically know how to run the script even though out of the box support for processing scripts.\n\nA further example of options can be seen in [sample-nodemon.md](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/sample-nodemon.md)\n\n### package.json\n\nIf you want to keep all your package configurations in one place, nodemon supports using `package.json` for configuration.\nSpecify the config in the same format as you would for a config file but under `nodemonConfig` in the `package.json` file, for example, take the following `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"nodemon\",\n  \"homepage\": \"http://nodemon.io\",\n  \"...\": \"... other standard package.json values\",\n  \"nodemonConfig\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\"test/*\", \"docs/*\"],\n    \"delay\": \"2500\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that if you specify a `--config` file or provide a local `nodemon.json` any `package.json` config is ignored.\n\n*This section needs better documentation, but for now you can also see `nodemon --help config` ([also here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/cli/config.txt))*.\n\n## Using nodemon as a module\n\nPlease see [doc/requireable.md](doc/requireable.md)\n\n## Using nodemon as child process\n\nPlease see [doc/events.md](doc/events.md#Using_nodemon_as_child_process)\n\n## Running non-node scripts\n\nnodemon can also be used to execute and monitor other programs. nodemon will read the file extension of the script being run and monitor that extension instead of `.js` if there's no `nodemon.json`:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --exec \"python -v\" ./app.py\n```\n\nNow nodemon will run `app.py` with python in verbose mode (note that if you're not passing args to the exec program, you don't need the quotes), and look for new or modified files with the `.py` extension.\n\n### Default executables\n\nUsing the `nodemon.json` config file, you can define your own default executables using the `execMap` property. This is particularly useful if you're working with a language that isn't supported by default by nodemon.\n\nTo add support for nodemon to know about the `.pl` extension (for Perl), the `nodemon.json` file would add:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"execMap\": {\n    \"pl\": \"perl\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow running the following, nodemon will know to use `perl` as the executable:\n\n```bash\nnodemon script.pl\n```\n\nIt's generally recommended to use the global `nodemon.json` to add your own `execMap` options. However, if there's a common default that's missing, this can be merged in to the project so that nodemon supports it by default, by changing [default.js](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/lib/config/defaults.js) and sending a pull request.\n\n## Monitoring multiple directories\n\nBy default nodemon monitors the current working directory. If you want to take control of that option, use the `--watch` option to add specific paths:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --watch app --watch libs app/server.js\n```\n\nNow nodemon will only restart if there are changes in the `./app` or `./libs` directory. By default nodemon will traverse sub-directories, so there's no need in explicitly including sub-directories.\n\nDon't use unix globbing to pass multiple directories, e.g `--watch ./lib/*`, it won't work. You need a `--watch` flag per directory watched.\n\n## Specifying extension watch list\n\nBy default, nodemon looks for files with the `.js`, `.mjs`, `.coffee`, `.litcoffee`, and `.json` extensions. If you use the `--exec` option and monitor `app.py` nodemon will monitor files with the extension of `.py`. However, you can specify your own list with the `-e` (or `--ext`) switch like so:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -e js,jade\n```\n\nNow nodemon will restart on any changes to files in the directory (or subdirectories) with the extensions `.js`, `.jade`.\n\n## Ignoring files\n\nBy default, nodemon will only restart when a `.js` JavaScript file changes. In some cases you will want to ignore some specific files, directories or file patterns, to prevent nodemon from prematurely restarting your application.\n\nThis can be done via the command line:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ignore lib/ --ignore tests/\n```\n\nOr specific files can be ignored:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ignore lib/app.js\n```\n\nPatterns can also be ignored (but be sure to quote the arguments):\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ignore 'lib/*.js'\n```\n\nNote that by default, nodemon will ignore the `.git`, `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `.nyc_output`, `coverage` and `.sass-cache` directories and *add* your ignored patterns to the list. If you want to indeed watch a directory like `node_modules`, you need to [override the underlying default ignore rules](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md#overriding-the-underlying-default-ignore-rules).\n\n## Application isn't restarting\n\nIn some networked environments (such as a container running nodemon reading across a mounted drive), you will need to use the `legacyWatch: true` which enables Chokidar's polling.\n\nVia the CLI, use either `--legacy-watch` or `-L` for short:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -L\n```\n\nThough this should be a last resort as it will poll every file it can find.\n\n## Delaying restarting\n\nIn some situations, you may want to wait until a number of files have changed. The timeout before checking for new file changes is 1 second. If you're uploading a number of files and it's taking some number of seconds, this could cause your app to restart multiple times unnecessarily.\n\nTo add an extra throttle, or delay restarting, use the `--delay` command:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 10 server.js\n```\n\nFor more precision, milliseconds can be specified.  Either as a float:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 2.5 server.js\n```\n\nOr using the time specifier (ms):\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 2500ms server.js\n```\n\nThe delay figure is number of seconds (or milliseconds, if specified) to delay before restarting. So nodemon will only restart your app the given number of seconds after the *last* file change.\n\nIf you are setting this value in `nodemon.json`, the value will always be interpreted in milliseconds. E.g., the following are equivalent:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 2.5\n\n{\n  \"delay\": \"2500\"\n}\n```\n\n## Controlling shutdown of your script\n\nnodemon sends a kill signal to your application when it sees a file update. If you need to clean up on shutdown inside your script you can capture the kill signal and handle it yourself.\n\nThe following example will listen once for the `SIGUSR2` signal (used by nodemon to restart), run the clean up process and then kill itself for nodemon to continue control:\n\n```js\nprocess.once('SIGUSR2', function () {\n  gracefulShutdown(function () {\n    process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGUSR2');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nNote that the `process.kill` is *only* called once your shutdown jobs are complete. Hat tip to [Benjie Gillam](http://www.benjiegillam.com/2011/08/node-js-clean-restart-and-faster-development-with-nodemon/) for writing this technique up.\n\n## Triggering events when nodemon state changes\n\nIf you want growl like notifications when nodemon restarts or to trigger an action when an event happens, then you can either `require` nodemon or add event actions to your `nodemon.json` file.\n\nFor example, to trigger a notification on a Mac when nodemon restarts, `nodemon.json` looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": {\n    \"restart\": \"osascript -e 'display notification \\\"app restarted\\\" with title \\\"nodemon\\\"'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA full list of available events is listed on the [event states wiki](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/wiki/Events#states). Note that you can bind to both states and messages.\n\n## Pipe output to somewhere else\n\n```js\nnodemon({\n  script: ...,\n  stdout: false // important: this tells nodemon not to output to console\n}).on('readable', function() { // the `readable` event indicates that data is ready to pick up\n  this.stdout.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));\n  this.stderr.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('err.txt'));\n});\n```\n\n## Using nodemon in your gulp workflow\n\nCheck out the [gulp-nodemon](https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's gulp workflow.\n\n## Using nodemon in your Grunt workflow\n\nCheck out the [grunt-nodemon](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's grunt workflow.\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n> nodemon, is it pronounced: node-mon, no-demon or node-e-mon (like pokémon)?\n\nWell...I've been asked this many times before. I like that I've been asked this before. There's been bets as to which one it actually is.\n\nThe answer is simple, but possibly frustrating. I'm not saying (how I pronounce it). It's up to you to call it as you like. All answers are correct :)\n\n## Design principles\n\n- Less flags is better\n- Works across all platforms\n- Less features\n- Let individuals build on top of nodemon\n- Offer all CLI functionality as an API\n- Contributions must have and pass tests\n\nNodemon is not perfect, and CLI arguments has sprawled beyond where I'm completely happy, but perhaps it can be reduced a little one day.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) and please add your own questions if you think they would help others.\n\n## Backers\n\nThank you to all [our backers](https://opencollective.com/nodemon#backer)! 🙏\n\n[![nodemon backers](https://opencollective.com/nodemon/backers.svg?width=890)](https://opencollective.com/nodemon#backers)\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.
